## Kernal 
#### kernel is the central compenent of OS .
----------------------------------------------------
### Some task of kernal 
1. It manages operation of memory ,disk and task
2. It is responsible for various tasks such as disk management, task management, and memory management
3. To decide state of process. ([Process State Definition](http://www.linfo.org/process_state.html#:~:text=Process%20state%20is%20the%20state,of%20a%20program%20in%20execution.))
-----------------------------------------------------
### Types of kernal 
1. [Monolithic kernal](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/microkernel-in-operating-systems/)
2. [Micro kernal](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/microkernel-in-operating-systems/) 
3. [Hybrid kernal](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27004/hybrid-kernel#:~:text=Hybrid%20kernel%20is%20a%20kernel,and%20execution%20safety%20of%20microkernel.)
4. [Exo kernal](https://medium.com/@vithushaaarabhi/exokernels-an-operating-system-architecture-for-application-level-resource-management-32d0daaeeab0)
5. [Nano kernal](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27005/nano-kernel)(It is similar to micro kernal but small in size)
-----------------------------------------------------
## Diff. between kernel and terminal
#### Every OS has a kernal . The kernel is the bridge that connect between hardware and program .It opens with OS and close during shutdown wheras <br/>
#### a terminal application opens a window where the user can type in commands for the shell to interpret into binary language for the kernel.
